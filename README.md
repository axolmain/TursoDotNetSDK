# Dotnet Turso Platform SDK

The Dotnet Turso Platform SDK is a ... Dotnet ... library for developing applications using the Turso Platform API. 

The SDK is on track to covering all [Platform API](https://docs.turso.tech/api-reference/introduction) resources and will eventually replace the need to use the Turso API with C#.

Learn more about the [Turso](https://docs.turso.tech/introduction).

I'm not a giant fan of API's so I thought I'd become the middle man so I don't need to use one. That being said, this is very much in development right now so any PR's is appreciated.
